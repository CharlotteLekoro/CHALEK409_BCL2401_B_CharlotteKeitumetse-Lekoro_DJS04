Challenges I encountered:

This was a big challenge because it took almost  days to figure out what needed to be done, I struggled to get help because everyone else was also tyring to figure out what to do so people were not in a position to look at someone elses code and we were all having a har time. 

From the commits its clear that  the bulk of the work on this code was made this morning, most of the clarity came aftet the coaching session i had a idea of what needed to happen but after the confirmation from the coach i was able to move forward and complete the code and able to submit the work that i have done and I now have a better understanding of the work. Its not a lot of understanding but i am at a better place now
